        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>

            In my early twenties, I initially pursued a Bachelor's degree in architecture and
            urbanism. At that time, the realm of Information Technology (IT)
            had not yet been introduced to me. While obtaining my architecture degree,
            my exposure to coding and app development started through self-learning,
            utilizing resources such as Android Studio and instructional videos on YouTube.

            Upon being presented with the opportunity to relocate to Belgium. Couldn't continue
            studying architecture in Belgium because of language difficulties.
            Consequently, I look for English-language programs and discovered the
            "Applied Computer Science" program at Thomas More.
            It was during this exploration that I developed a profound appreciation
            for the program, prompting my decision to immerse myself in the field of
            computer science.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            From an early age, reading has been my preferred pastime during moments of
            leisure. Over time, I have engaged in a variety of activities, including knitting,
            cross-stitching, cycling, and writing. Recently, my interest has expanded to the
            realm of Internet of Things (IoT), where I find myself immersed in tutorials,
            connecting cables, coding, and orchestrating the functionality of devices.
            This newfound pursuit has evolved into a meaningful way to occupy my free time.

        <h1>Professional Background</h1>
        <p>
            As a student of architecture, I embarked on an entrepreneurial venture,
            independently undertaking design projects for residential and commercial spaces.
            Subsequently, I joined the "Instituto Metropolitano de Planificación – IMP," a
            government entity, where I conducted comprehensive analyses of San Borja, Lima, Peru.
            Collaborating with a team of professionals, we formulated and presented urban
            planning solutions to address the city's challenges.

            Following this experience, I contributed my skills to "Tektum Construcción y
            Arquitectura SAC," a prominent architecture studio. Within the design sector,
            I leveraged my analytical abilities to understand client requirements and deliver
            optimal proposals. Later, at "WAO – World Architecture Office," my responsibilities
            extended to the construction sector. In a supervisory role, I demonstrated leadership
            skills, gaining insights into sector-specific processes.

            Throughout my professional journey, I diversified my experience by engaging in
            various roles, including sales and customer service in call centers, pet store
            operations, restaurant dishwashing, warehouse management, and roles as a fast packer,
            barista, and bartender. My work ethic is deeply oriented towards achieving the goals
            of the organizations I serve, consistently surpassing expectations with favorable
            outcomes.
