                    <p class="card-text">In my early twenties, I initially pursued a Bachelor's degree in architecture and
                        urbanism. At that time, the realm of Information Technology (IT)
                        had not yet been introduced to me. While obtaining my architecture degree,
                        my exposure to coding and app development started through self-learning,
                        utilizing resources such as Android Studio and instructional videos on YouTube.

                        Upon being presented with the opportunity to relocate to Belgium. Couldn't continue
                        studying architecture in Belgium because of language difficulties.
                        Consequently, I look for English-language programs and discovered the
                        "Applied Computer Science" program at Thomas More.
                        It was during this exploration that I developed a profound appreciation
                        for the program, prompting my decision to immerse myself in the field of
                        computer science.</p>

                        leisure. Over time, I have engaged in a variety of activities, including knitting,
                        cross-stitching, cycling, and writing. Recently, my interest has expanded to the
                        realm of Internet of Things (IoT), where I find myself immersed in tutorials,
                        connecting cables, coding, and orchestrating the functionality of devices.
                        This newfound pursuit has evolved into a meaningful way to occupy my free time.</p>

                        independently undertaking design projects for residential and commercial spaces.
                        Subsequently, I joined the "Instituto Metropolitano de Planificación – IMP," a
                        government entity, where I conducted comprehensive analyses of San Borja, Lima, Peru.
                        Collaborating with a team of professionals, we formulated and presented urban
                        planning solutions to address the city's challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Following this experience, I contributed my skills to "Tektum Construcción y
                        Arquitectura SAC," a prominent architecture studio. Within the design sector,
                        I leveraged my analytical abilities to understand client requirements and deliver
                        optimal proposals. Later, at "WAO – World Architecture Office," my responsibilities
                        extended to the construction sector. In a supervisory role, I demonstrated leadership
                        skills, gaining insights into sector-specific processes.

                    <p class="card-text">Throughout my professional journey, I diversified my experience by engaging in

                        barista, and bartender. My work ethic is deeply oriented towards achieving the goals

                        Over the last few years, the awareness of memory-related challenges affecting people’s lives has
                        increased, these challenges are significant difficulties in managing their daily lives, including appointments,
                        tasks, and medication routines. Taking into account this need, in this report we would like to propose the
                        development of an application that focuses on assisting people with memory problems in organizing and
                        managing their daily lives.

                        Our target audience, that deals with memory issues, often struggle with their weekly schedules. From
                        unique and recurring appointments to daily routines and medication management, the complexities of their
                        lives required a reliable and intuitive solution. Many of our target audience rely on other individuals, like
                        relatives, informal carers to keep track to their activities, but the challenge lies in tracking tasks,
                        appointments, and medication processes effectively.

                        The app wants to do more than just help with daily tasks and medication. It also wants to tackle the problem
                        of forgetting important details. It encourages friends, carers, and helpers to join in. Together, they can
                        create a detailed log. This log doesn't just help the person remember events, but it also gives everyone a
                        better understanding of how the person is doing overall.
